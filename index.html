            <p id="flex1">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design
                skills and
                attract more
                customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
                stored on my cell phone,
                I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw
                that many designers
                (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
                that the result was
                just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>
