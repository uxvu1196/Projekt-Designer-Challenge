            <p id="flex1">Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design
                skills and
                attract more
                customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
                stored on my cell phone,
                I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I thought. I saw
                that many designers
                (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was
                that the result was
                just something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

notebook and start writing down all the ideas that come to mind.
Design your proposal
How can design help solve your problem? It's time to think about features and functionality, and then start designing.
Don’t forget to always ask yourself: Would I actually use this?
